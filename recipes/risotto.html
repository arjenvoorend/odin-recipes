<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This creamy main dish gets a splash of color with the addition of zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil. With much
  less butter than in a typical risotto recipe and no wine, there's no running around for ingredients you don't have on
  hand! The result is a lovely, light flavor in a very filling meal.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>7 cups vegetable or chicken stock</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
  <li>2 cups Arborio rice, uncooked</li>
  <li>Â½ medium zucchini, thinly sliced with a vegetable peeler</li>
  <li>10 sun-dried tomatoes, softened and chopped</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed</li>
  <li>6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan (or mozzarella) cheese</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves, or to taste (Optional)</li>
  <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Bring vegetable or chicken stock to a boil in a medium stock pot, then reduce heat to a low simmer.</li>
  <li>Melt butter in a large, heavy bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook for 2 minutes, or until
    softened. Add the rice and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. Gradually ladle
    in simmering vegetable stock, stirring continuously. Risotto will become "creamy" and slightly sticky, yet still
    firm in the center, or al dente.</li>
  <li>When almost finished, stir in the zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and thyme, adding stock as needed and stirring
    continuously. Stir in basil and 3 tablespoons cheese just before serving. Divide risotto among 6 bowls, sprinkle
    with remaining cheese, and season with pepper to taste.</li>
</ol>
